Delve into the sobering reality of the World Health Organization's ongoing struggle to combat HIV incidence. We explore the data and understand the challenges in this vital mission to keep people safe and healthy worldwide.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, while substantial progress has been made in addressing the HIV pandemic, the current pace of decrease in new HIV infections is insufficient to meet the goal of ending AIDS by 2030. As of 2022, approximately **39 million** people lived with HIV globally, with nearly **1.3 million** new infections reported annually.

The global target for HIV status awareness is set at **95%** by 2025, and as of 2022, **86%** of people living with HIV knew their status.

To combat the epidemic, the WHO supports countries in implementing the **90-90-90 targets**, aiming for 90% of all people living with HIV knowing their status, 90% of all diagnosed individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of all people receiving ART achieving viral suppression.

While the percentage of people receiving ART has grown significantly, reaching **76%** in 2022, the rate of new HIV infections remains *too high to eliminate the virus* ([powerBI report containing the numbers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nr3_MFDfQp0xJL07gScFM11TsB_3hf0X/view?usp=sharing)). 

To overcome these challenges, the WHO emphasizes the importance of increasing access to prevention measures, such as condoms, voluntary medical male circumcision, harm reduction, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

Additionally, the organization highlights the need for better integration of HIV services with broader healthcare systems and the necessity of ongoing investment in research and innovation to develop new tools and strategies for combatting the virus.
